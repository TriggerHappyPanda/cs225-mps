Seeing that the majority of the devices at the party are made by Apple, he decides to speak to Steve Jobs.  Einstein starts asking Steve about the technologies of the modern world, and how it all came to be. Steve tells him all he needs to know. How it started with Einstein's peer, Alan Turing, and how it evolved over the years. After he speaks to Steve, Einstein feels he has learned enough about modern society, and proceeds on his adventure to learn about the past.

A few moments later Einstein chose to go into the past and learn more about history. He reaches 1655 in the middle of London. The people around him look at his contraption in awe. Some start believing he is a sorcerer and within hours of reaching there, Einstein regrets his decision as he is executed for witchcraft.

A few moments later Einstein chose to go into the prehistoric era and learn more about the begining of the human race. When he gets there, he notices some very short humans, communicating using indiscernable noises. Standing next to them are animals that resemble dogs, but look much more vicious, almost like a wolf but not quite enough. Facinated by the early humans he looks around to observe more. He turns around and standing behind him is a giant woolly mammoth. He tries to run for his life, but unlike his prehistoric peers, he does not know how to deal with the situation and is trampled by the beast.
